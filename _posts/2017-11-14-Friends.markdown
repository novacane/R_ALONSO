Make it fun, draw it easy.
ThatÂ´s what i say to me when im trying to explain something to other person, becasue in not like to talk with genres, i prefer to speak with humans after all, not divided by biometricals characteristics. I and my parner life, have lgbt+ friends and we feel very proud of them, cause they do what ther really make feel happy , without to hurt something else.
