It´s my first year like a web developer, co-workers always talk to me , like im a little boy, buts its doesn´t matter.


This years i really feel,  so proud of what i can make coding, not just making money, im talking about meet people, and get more knowledge in these long way.

Taking challenges, listening new music , having new incredible partners. And having fun with really important people.
